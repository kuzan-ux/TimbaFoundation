                <p>One of the major problems the African society is faced with is child and youth crime. The root cause of this problem is immediately traced to the presence of limited economic opportunities and lack of capacity development for leadership and innovation.
                The subject of entrepreneurship development and promotion is quite germane to Africa's economic growth and with inadequate institutional attention being paid to this problem, there is an urgent and fundamental need for private/ corporate efforts to alleviate the problem of child and youth crime and vices in Africa.</p>

                <p>My experience in Timba Entrepreneur Foundation was a wonderful one, through the practical classes, I got trained in hairmaking.
                Prior to the training, I did not know anything about hairmaking but after the programme, I got inspired to start my hair and wig making business.
                At the inception of the business, I went through several challenges but I was prepared for them because we had been trained at the business development classes to expect challenges and what our response should be.
                All thanks to God my business is stable and flourishing. I want to say a big thank you to the Timba Entrepreneur Foundation  team, facilitators, partners and sponsors for they are really doing a great job impacting the lives of youths. God bless you, Long live Timba Entrepreneur Foundation.

                <p>My name is Ruth Cherish, I went through the Timba Entrepreneur Foundation training in February 2018, I was trained on how to bake. 
                Amazingly, during the course of the training I wasn't sure of what to do with all the information I was getting, but one thing I made sure of was not to miss any of the sessions ( business development and practical training).
                Thank God Timba Entrepreneur Foundation is like a compass, it gives you direction and the teachings I got informed my decisions on starting a chin chin business. Now I supply to people for household consumption and ceremonies.
                It was really an amazing time in Timba Entrepreneur Foundation, and I am really grateful for your support in helping me make money and helping me find a place in the society.

                The training lasted for a few weeks and beyond the vocational skills I got , I learned how to harness my gifts and get money from my passion.
                Also, I we were taught about business management, customer relations and general life skills. I currently run a beauty business and I am able to support myself financially. I am grateful to Timba Entrepreneur Foundation and their partners for the life transforming opportunity they give young people.

                In 2015, I enrolled in Timba Entrepreneur Foundation and what I learned was beyond words. The business development sessions prepared and built me tough for my entrepreneurial journey and the practical classes equipped my hands and minds with the technical knowledge I required.
                Today I am a fashion designer, I have clients both individual and organisations in Lagos state and outside Lagos state.
                From the depths of my heart, I am saying a big thank you to TIMBA ENTREPRENEUR FOUNDATION for believing in me and equipping with the right mindset and skill for my entrepreneurship journey. Thank you for helping me find purpose.

                <p>I remember in the month of November 2015. I was informed by a friend to attend an entrepreneurship and skills acquisition training program at RCCG, HOUSE OF FAVOUR AND WITH JOY, i quickly said YES I AM COMING.The reason is because i was just learning Graphics Designing at that time. I was so eager to join in the free training, attending the traning changed my life beyond acquiring skills in Graphics Design, i learnt so much more. How to navigate the world of entreprenuership and standing out in what i do. The teaching i received at the traning guides me in my day to day activities till this day, and it has been phenomenal. I am proud to be an Alumni of Timba Entrepreneur Foundation, i'm glad they chose me. Now i meet people's Graphic Designing needs at a commercial value, also i train others on Graphics and basic computer skills at a fee. GOD Bless Timba Entrepreneur Foundation and the entire team.
